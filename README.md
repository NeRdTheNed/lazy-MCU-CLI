# lazy MCU-CLI
Some bad shell scripts to wrap and manage MCI instances. If something is worth doing, it's worth doing badly. 

# NOT EVEN REMOTELY DONE, NOTHING WORKS RIGHT NOW, COME BACK WHEN THIS MESSAGE IS GONE

This repository will be a home to many hacked together bash and batch scripts that aren’t that great, but are functional some of the time. 
These use MCUpdater CLI to install and manage instances of Minecraft. 
Some things of note: none of these scripts have been tested very thoroughly, and the shell scripts have not been verified to work outside of MacOS. 
Specifically licenced under The Unlicence because I don’t want to maintain them that much :P
